      <strong> (This story was created with a random story generator.) </strong> <br> Once upon a time there was a delightful girl called Kelly. She was on the way to see her Suki Thornton, when she decided to take a short cut through Central Park.

It wasn't long before Kelly got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Spike, but Spike was nowhere to be found! Kelly began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Spike. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.

Unexpectedly, she saw a feathery monkey dressed in a purple t-shirt disappearing into the trees.

"How odd!" thought Kelly.<br>

<br>
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed monkey. Perhaps it could tell her the way out of the forest.

Eventually, Kelly reached a clearing. In the clearing were two houses, one made from lettuces and one made from sweets.

Kelly could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger. There was a sign in front of her that said Kelly could
only choose one house to go inside, but one of them containted poisen and one of them did not.
